# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! This site is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. Below, youâ€™ll find an overview of the technologies used, features implemented, and how to view or contribute to the project.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website serves as an online resume, allowing potential employers and collaborators to view my projects and contact me. It includes:

- **Personal information**: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **Projects**: A dynamic project showcase, filterable by technology.
- **Contact form**: A way to reach me directly through the website.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling with utility-first classes.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features such as the project search functionality.
- **JSON**: To store project data, making it easy to update or extend with new projects.
- **GitHub**: For version control and source code hosting.

## Features

### Semantic HTML for Better Accessibility
- Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` ensure the website is easy to read and accessible to screen readers.

Example:
```html
<nav id="header" class="fixed top-0 w-full bg-white shadow-md">
    <a href="#home" class="nav-link">Home</a>
    <a href="#about" class="nav-link">About</a>
</nav>
```

### Tailwind CSS for Modern, Responsive Design
- Utilized Tailwind CSS to quickly build responsive layouts and ensure the site works on all devices.
  
Example:
```html
<button class="btn bg-green-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-green-700">
    Download CV
</button>
```

### JavaScript for Project Search Functionality
- Integrated a **search feature** that filters projects stored in a `JSON` file based on user input. This makes it easier for visitors to find relevant projects.

#### JSON File (`projects.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Portfolio Website",
    "description": "A website to showcase my personal projects and skills.",
    "technologies": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
    "link": "https://myportfolio.com/portfolio"
  },
  {
    "title": "E-commerce Platform",
    "description": "A fully-functional online store with payment gateway integration.",
    "technologies": ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],
    "link": "https://myportfolio.com/ecommerce"
  }
]
```

#### JavaScript Search Function
```javascript
// Fetch projects from JSON file and display them
async function fetchProjects() {
    const response = await fetch('projects.json');
    const projects = await response.json();
    displayProjects(projects);
}

// Display filtered projects based on search input
function displayProjects(projects) {
    const projectContainer = document.getElementById('project-list');
    const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input').value.toLowerCase();

    const filteredProjects = projects.filter(project => 
        project.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchInput) ||
        project.technologies.some(tech => tech.toLowerCase().includes(searchInput))
    );

    projectContainer.innerHTML = filteredProjects.map(project => `
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>${project.title}</h3>
            <p>${project.description}</p>
            <p>Technologies: ${project.technologies.join(', ')}</p>
            <a href="${project.link}" class="text-blue-500">View Project</a>
        </div>
    `).join('');
}

// Add event listener to search input
document.getElementById('search-input').addEventListener('input', fetchProjects);

// Initial load of projects
fetchProjects();
```
